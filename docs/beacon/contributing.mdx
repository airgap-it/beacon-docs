We welcome any kind of contribution to the `beacon-sdk`. If you find bugs or have feature requests, feel free to open an issue on github.

If you plan to add a new feature and create a Pull Request, please quickly reach out to us first so we can make sure the changes can be included.

To set up the project, run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run build
$ npm run test
```

Once the SDK is built, you can open the `example-dapp.html` file in your browser and try out the basic functionality.
To support browser extensions as well, the file should be viewed over a webserver.
You can easily start one with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` and then open the file with `http://localhost:8000/example-dapp.html`.

There is also a `example-wallet.html` file where a basic permission request can be tested.

If you plan to use both the dapp and wallet examples, make sure you use different browsers, otherwise the shared local storage causes problems.
