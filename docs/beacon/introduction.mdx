Beacon is the implementation of the [tzip-10 proposal](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/tree/master/proposals/tzip-10), which describes an interaction standard between a wallet and a dApp.

A dApp impelementing the [beacon-sdk](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-sdk) can build up a channel and send messages over a peer to peer communication layer to a wallet. This allows for a communication for example of a mobile wallet with a desktop application. The requests of the dApp are sent to the wallet, signed and returned to the application. The `beacon-sdk` can also communicate to chrome extensions if compatible ones are installed.

The `beacon-sdk` should allow developers to integrate this functionality with minimal coding, but still be customizable to support more complex flows.

## Design Principles

The `beacon-sdk` handles almost everything for you, but is still customizable if needed.
It detects whether or not a browser extension is installed, tracks what connections have been established and the accounts that have been shared with the dApp.

Generally, you only have to initialize a DAppClient instance (see [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/example)), the rest should be handled for you.
Refer to the [examples](/docs/guides/getting-started) section for some common use cases.

## Messages

The messages used in the Beacon communication are defined in the [tzip-10 proposal](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/tree/master/proposals/tzip-10).

Every message contains a unique, random ID that allows use to match request and response. It also contains the ID of the sender.

Some of the messages accept a network as input (default is mainnet). This is used to ask for permissions or broadcast a transaction on another network. This can either be a testnet, or a local development setup.

To see all message types, please refer to the typedocs (TODO Link).

## Errors

The errors used in the Beacon communication are defined in the [tzip-10 proposal](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/tree/master/proposals/tzip-10).

If the wallet encounters an error while processing a request, the response will return an error.

To see all error types, please refer to the typedocs (TODO Link).

## Default UI Elements

The `beacon-sdk` includes default UI elements for pairing wallets and show the status of a request.
**We highly discourage the overwriting of the default UI elements.**
You can read more details about this in the [UI Elements](/docs/advanced/ui-elements) section.
