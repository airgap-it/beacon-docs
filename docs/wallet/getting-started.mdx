First, you need to install the `beacon-sdk` package.

`npm install --save @airgap/beacon-sdk`

After that you need to import the Beacon SDK in your code and initialize the WalletClient.

The `beacon-sdk` will automatically try to establish a connection and listen to all Beacon messages.

```ts
import {
  WalletClient,
  BeaconMessageType,
  PermissionScope,
  PermissionResponseInput,
} from "@airgap/beacon-sdk";

const connectApp = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const client = new WalletClient({ name: "My Wallet" });
  await client.init(); // Establish P2P connection

  client
    .connect(async (message) => {
      console.log("beacon message", message);

      // Let's assume it's a permission request, but we obviously need to handle all request types
      if (message.type === BeaconMessageType.PermissionRequest) {
        // Here we would show a UI to the user where he can confirm everything that has been requested in the beacon message

        // We hardcode a response
        const response: PermissionResponseInput = {
          type: BeaconMessageType.PermissionResponse,
          network: message.network, // Use the same network that the user requested
          scopes: [PermissionScope.OPERATION_REQUEST], // Ignore the scopes that have been requested and instead give only operation permissions
          id: message.id,
          publicKey: "tezos public key",
        };

        await client.respond(response);
      } else {
        // Handle all other requests
      }
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error("connect error", error));
};

connectApp().catch((error) => console.error("connect error", error));
```
