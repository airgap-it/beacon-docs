In Beacon SDK, various events are emitted to signal different states and actions in the application's lifecycle. <br />
These events provide developers with hooks to respond to changes, errors, user interactions, and other significant occurrences in the application flow.<br />
Understanding and handling these events correctly is crucial for building robust and user-friendly applications. <br />
