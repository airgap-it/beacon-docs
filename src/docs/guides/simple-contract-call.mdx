title: Simple Contract Call
---

import { RunnableCode } from "@site/src/components/RunnableCode";

The following example shows how to do a simple contract call with Beacon.

:::tip
The `beacon-sdk` itself does not do any type checking on the parameters you pass. Use taquito if you don't want to construct the parameters yourself.
:::

The wallet will process and validate the operation. If there are any errors, they have to be displayed in the wallet. `run_operation` errors can optionally be sent back to the dApp as well.
