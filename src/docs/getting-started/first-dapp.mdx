title: First dApp

import { RunnableCode } from "@site/src/components/RunnableCode";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

## Installation

Let's get started with your first dApp. You have to install the necessary dependencies.

<Tabs
  groupId="beaconOrTaquito"
  defaultValue="beacon"
  values={[
    { label: "Beacon", value: "beacon" },
    { label: "Taquito", value: "taquito" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="beacon">

```bash
npm install --save @airgap/beacon-sdk
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="taquito">

```bash
npm install --save @taquito/taquito @taquito/beacon-wallet
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup

You can then import the `beacon-sdk` package and create a `DAppClient` instance. This instance will be used throughout your dApp to interact with the users wallet.
Once created, you can send a permission request to prompt the user to connect to his wallet.

<RunnableCode>

<!-- embedme getting-started-permission-request.beacon.ts -->

```ts
// TODO
```

<!-- embedme getting-started-permission-request.taquito.ts -->

```ts
// TODO
```

</RunnableCode>

After the connection is successfully established and the user has shared his account, the result will be returned.

:::info
The `DAppClient` instance should be a singleton. Avoid creating multiple copies of it, which could lead to unexpected behaviour.
:::

## Check

Now let's introduce a check to see if the SDK is already connected to the dApp.
This code should be run after the page is loaded to get the users address and show it in your UI.
If the following code returns an address, there is no need to send another permission request, unless you want to pair a different account.

<RunnableCode>

<!-- embedme getting-started-active-account.beacon.ts -->

```ts
// TODO
```

<!-- embedme getting-started-active-account.taquito.ts -->

```ts
// TODO
```

</RunnableCode>

The `beacon-sdk` is now fully set up and ready to receive operation requests.

## Operation Request

<RunnableCode>

<!-- embedme getting-started-operation-request.beacon.ts -->

```ts
// TODO
```

<!-- embedme getting-started-operation-request.taquito.ts -->

```ts
// TODO
```

</RunnableCode>
