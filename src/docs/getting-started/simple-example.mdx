import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The following example will show:

1. How to connect a dApp to a wallet
2. How to re-use an existing connection after a page refreshed
3. How to send an operation request

<Tabs
  groupId="beaconOrTaquitoSE"
  defaultValue="beacon"
  values={[
    { label: "Beacon", value: "beacon" },
    { label: "Taquito", value: "taquito" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="beacon">

```ts code
import { DAppClient, TezosOperationType } from "@airgap/beacon-sdk";

async () => {
  const dAppClient = new DAppClient({ name: "Beacon Docs" });

  let myAddress: string | undefined;

  // This code should be called every time the page is loaded or refreshed to see if the user has already connected to a wallet.
  const activeAccount = await dAppClient.getActiveAccount();
  if (activeAccount) {
    // If defined, the user is connected to a wallet.
    // You can now do an operation request, sign request, or send another permission request to switch wallet
    console.log("Already connected:", activeAccount.address);
    myAddress = activeAccount.address;
  } else {
    const permissions = await dAppClient.requestPermissions();
    console.log("New connection:", permissions.address);
    myAddress = permissions.address;
  }

  // At this point we are connected to an account.
  // Let's send a simple transaction to the wallet that sends 1 mutez to ourselves.
  const response = await dAppClient.requestOperation({
    operationDetails: [
      {
        kind: TezosOperationType.TRANSACTION,
        destination: myAddress, // Send to ourselves
        amount: "1", // Amount in mutez, the smallest unit in Tezos
      },
    ],
  });

  console.log("Operation Hash: ", response.transactionHash);
};
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="taquito">

```ts code
import { TezosToolkit } from "@taquito/taquito";
import { BeaconWallet } from "@taquito/beacon-wallet";
import { TezosOperationType } from "@airgap/beacon-sdk";

async () => {
  const Tezos = new TezosToolkit("https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io");
  const wallet = new BeaconWallet({ name: "Beacon Docs Taquito" }); // Takes the same arguments as the DAppClient constructor

  Tezos.setWalletProvider(wallet);

  let myAddress: string | undefined;

  // This code should be called every time the page is loaded or refreshed to see if the user has already connected to a wallet.
  const activeAccount = await wallet.client.getActiveAccount();
  if (activeAccount) {
    // If defined, the user is connected to a wallet.
    // You can now do an operation request, sign request, or send another permission request to switch wallet
    console.log("Already connected:", activeAccount.address);
    myAddress = activeAccount.address;
  } else {
    await wallet.requestPermissions();
    myAddress = await wallet.getPKH();
    console.log("New connection:", myAddress);
  }

  // At this point we are connected to an account.
  // Let's send a simple transaction to the wallet that sends 1 mutez to ourselves.
  const hash = await wallet.sendOperations([
    {
      kind: TezosOperationType.TRANSACTION,
      destination: myAddress, // Send to ourselves
      amount: "1", // Amount in mutez, the smallest unit in Tezos
    },
  ]);

  console.log("Operation Hash: ", hash);
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
