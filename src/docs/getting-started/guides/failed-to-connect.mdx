## Overview

If you encounter the WalletConnect error:

```
Failed to connect to relayer
```

it usually means your network connection is blocking or throttling the WebSocket relay service that WalletConnect uses. Using a VPN can help bypass these network restrictions.
This guide walks you through installing and activating NordVPN, one of the most reliable VPN services, on your desktop or mobile device.

## Prerequisites

- A valid NordVPN subscription. If you don't have one yet, sign up at [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com).
- Administrative rights on your computer or device.
