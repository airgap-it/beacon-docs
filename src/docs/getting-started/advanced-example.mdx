import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The following example will show:

1. How to set the correct color mode
2. How to connect a dApp to a wallet
3. How to re-use an existing connection after a page refreshed
4. How to send an operation request
5. How to "disconnect" a wallet
