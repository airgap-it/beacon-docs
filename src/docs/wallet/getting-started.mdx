title: Getting Started

First, you need to install the `beacon-sdk` package.

`npm install --save @airgap/beacon-sdk`

After that you need to import the Beacon SDK in your code and initialize the WalletClient.

The `beacon-sdk` will automatically establish a connection and listen to all Beacon messages.

:::caution
The RPC URL that is provided by the DApp can be an insecure http:// connection. The reason for this is because it allows for easy development with a local node, without setting up a local SSL certificate.

Especially the wallet should care about this and potentially show a warning to the user if the RPC URL is not a secure https:// URL.

```ts
import {
  WalletClient,
  BeaconMessageType,
  PermissionScope,
  PermissionResponseInput,
} from "@airgap/beacon-sdk";

const connectApp = async (): Promise<void> => {
  // Only ONE WalletClient should be created and reused everywhere.
  const client = new WalletClient({ name: "My Wallet" });
  await client.init(); // Establish P2P connection

  client
    .connect(async (message) => {
      console.log("beacon message", message);

      let response: BeaconResponseInputMessage
      switch (message.type) {
        case BeaconMessageType.PermissionRequest:
          // Prompt user for permissions. If multiple accounts are available, let user choose one of them

          response = {
            type: BeaconMessageType.PermissionResponse,
            network: message.network, // Use the same network that the user requested
            scopes: message.scopes,
            id: message.id,
            publicKey: '3b92229274683b311cf8b040cf91ac0f8e19e410f06eda5537ef077e718e0024'
          }

          // Optional
          // If the user aborts an action at any time, you can send back an error:
          response = {
            type: BeaconMessageType.Error,
            id: message.id,
            errorType: BeaconErrorType.ABORTED_ERROR
          }

          break
        case BeaconMessageType.SignPayloadRequest:
          // Sign message.payload and return signature

          response = {
            type: BeaconMessageType.SignPayloadResponse,
            id: message.id,
            signingType: message.signingType,
            signature: 'edsig...'
          }

          break
        case BeaconMessageType.OperationRequest:
          // Prepare transaction based on the details give in message.operationDetails
          // message.operationDetails only contains a partial tezos transaction. Not all fields are mandatory
          // The fields that are not present (eg. counter, fee, gas_limit) have to be set by the wallet
          // If one of the optional fields is set, then that one should be used and not replaced by the wallet

          response = {
            type: BeaconMessageType.OperationResponse,
            id: message.id,
            transactionHash: 'op...'
          }

          // Optional
          // If the transaction cannot be prepared, (eg. run_operations fails), an error containing the rpc error can be returned
          let error = [
            {
              kind: 'temporary',
              id: 'proto.008-PtEdo2Zk.contract.balance_too_low',
              contract: 'tz1...',
              balance: '100',
              amount: '200'
            }
          ] // RPC error
          response = {
            type: BeaconMessageType.Error,
            id: message.id,
            errorType: BeaconErrorType.TRANSACTION_INVALID_ERROR,
            errorData: error
          }

          break
        case BeaconMessageType.BroadcastRequest:
          response = {
            type: BeaconMessageType.OperationResponse,
            id: message.id,
            transactionHash: 'op...'
          }

          break
        default:
          response = {
            type: BeaconMessageType.Error,
            id: (message as any).id, // Typescript assumes message is of type "never", but we should still add this to handle any potential future messages we don't support yet.
            errorType: BeaconErrorType.ABORTED_ERROR
          }
      }
      
      client.respond(response)
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error("connect error", error));
};

connectApp().catch((error) => console.error("connect error", error));
```

By adding the code above, our app is now ready to receive messages. Now all that is left for us to do is connecting to a DApp.

To establish a connection over the P2P network, a handshake message has to be given from the dApp to the wallet. How this is done depends on the platform.
It can be through QR scanning, Deeplinks or Copy-Pasting the handshake message. Once the handshake is received, the new peer has to be added:

```typescript

const isBeaconMessage: (obj: unknown) => obj is P2PPairingRequest = (obj: unknown): obj is P2PPairingRequest => {
  return (
    typeof (obj as P2PPairingRequest).name === 'string' &&
    typeof (obj as P2PPairingRequest).publicKey === 'string' &&
    typeof (obj as P2PPairingRequest).relayServer === 'string'
  )
}

const handshakeMessage = '' // This was received from the dApp, eg. through QR scanning or deeplink

const deserialized = (await new Serializer().deserialize(handshakeMessage))

if (isBeaconMessage(deserialized)) {
  // This will add the peer and establish a connection
  client.addPeer(peerInfo)
}

```

That's it, now the dApp and the Wallet are connected.

There are some additional features that the `WalletClient` provides, such as `client.getPermissions()` or `client.getPeers()` to listing all the connected peers and permissions that were granted to dApps.

Using `client.removePeer(peer)` the wallet can disconnect from a peer. If this is done, the dApp will receive a message that the wallet has disconnected.
